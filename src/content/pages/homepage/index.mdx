Hi, I'm Miguel Omar, a Computer Science professional with a strong background in data analysis, specializing in building predictive models using Python. I enjoy working with data to uncover insights and make complex information accessible through clear visualizations and spreadsheets.

I’m skilled in SQL and MySQL for managing relational databases, and I use Pandas for powerful data manipulation. I’m also comfortable working in Linux environments and with cloud-based database systems. Beyond data, I enjoy programming in C, C++, and Python—languages I’ve grown particularly fond of over time.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about video games, technology, and digital products. I love spending time with my family and friends—especially with my dogs, who always bring joy to my days.

I’m always open to new ideas, collaborations, and opportunities to create meaningful things with code and data. Let’s connect!
